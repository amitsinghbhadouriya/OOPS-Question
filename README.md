<br>
<b>Question-12</b>
<br>
<p>Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following functions and print the final salary. 
1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameters 
2 - 'AddSal()' which adds $10 to the salary of the employee if it is less than $500.

<br>
<b>Question-13</b>
<br>
<p>13. Create a class called 'Matrix' containing constructor that initializes the number of rows and the number of columns of a new Matrix object. The Matrix class has the following information: <br>
1 - number of rows of matrix <br>
2 - number of columns of matrix  <br>
3 - elements of matrix (You can use 2D vector) <br>
The Matrix class has functions for each of the following: <br>
